- Adjustable detection range for custom applications.
- Visual feedback through LEDs and serial communication.
- Simple and easy-to-understand Arduino code.

## Requirements

To successfully build and use the Arduino-Based Radar System, you will need the following components:

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Ultrasonic sensors (e.g., HC-SR04)
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- LEDs and resistors (optional, for visual feedback)
- Computer with Arduino IDE installed

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository to your computer.
2. Connect the ultrasonic sensors to the Arduino board as per the wiring diagram provided in the repository.
3. Open the Arduino IDE on your computer.
4. Open the `radar_system.ino` file from the downloaded repository.
5. Connect your Arduino board to your computer using a USB cable.
6. Select the appropriate board and port from the Arduino IDE's Tools menu.
7. Click on the "Upload" button in the Arduino IDE to upload the code to your Arduino board.

## Usage

1. Make sure the Arduino board is properly connected to the ultrasonic sensors and your computer.
2. Open the Arduino IDE and upload the code to the Arduino board.
3. Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE to view the range detection output.
4. Adjust the detection range in the code if desired.
5. Place objects within the radar's range and observe the range measurements.
6. Optionally, connect LEDs to the Arduino board for visual feedback.
7. Enjoy experimenting and exploring the capabilities of the Arduino-Based Radar System!
